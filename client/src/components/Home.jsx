              The Food Bank is a concept where people can donate money and food
              to help those who are impacted by the food crisis. People can
              donate food or money through this app, as well as identify those
              who are affected by the food crisis. The system's objective is to
              make food donations more effective and efficient while also
              developing a user-friendly platform to donate. In that regard, the
              system aids in persuading individuals to perform these social
              tasksssss. In the modern world, these donation processes are intertwined with the IT industry, which 
              makes those processes more convenient and efficient. There are many platforms that 
              provide this service for people. As a result of numerous donation software systems donators 
              can donate easily and anyone living anywhere in the world can contribute to it. Through these 
              online platforms, people can get clear information about the ongoing process after the donation, 
              and they can donate money through online payment gateways. The positive outcome of this is 
              people are more interacting with donating compared to the past.
